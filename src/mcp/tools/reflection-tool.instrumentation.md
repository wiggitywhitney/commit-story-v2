# Instrumentation Report: src/mcp/tools/reflection-tool.js

## Summary
- **Status**: success
- **Spans added**: 0
- **Attempts**: 2 (multi-turn-fix)
- **Input tokens**: 1.4K
- **Output tokens**: 7.5K

## Validation Journey
1. **Attempt 1**: 2 blocking errors (NDS-005 (Control Flow Preserved):1, NDS-007 (Expected Catch Unmodified):1)
2. **Attempt 2**: 0 errors

## Notes
- All exported functions are synchronous (registerReflectionTool) — no async I/O to trace. No LLM call made.

## Advisory Findings
- COV-004 (Async Operation Spans):65: COV-004 (Async Operation Spans) fired because this async function doesn't have a span. Without one, traces have a gap here — callers can see time was spent and whether an error occurred, but not what happened inside this function. Add a span unless this is a pure synchronous utility with no I/O (RST-001 exemption) — context propagation covers unexported internal helpers.

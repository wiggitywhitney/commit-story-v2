## Function-Level Results

| Function | Status | Spans |
|----------|--------|-------|
| readDayEntries | skipped — Validation failed: COV-003, NDS-003 — COV-003 check failed: catch block at line 27 does not record error on span. Add span.recordException(error) and span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR }) in catch blocks to ensure errors are visible in traces. | 0 |
| formatDailySummary | instrumented | 0 |
| saveDailySummary | instrumented | 1 |
| generateAndSaveDailySummary | instrumented | 1 |
| getWeekBoundaries | instrumented | 0 |
| readWeekDailySummaries | instrumented | 1 |
| formatWeeklySummary | instrumented | 0 |
| saveWeeklySummary | instrumented | 1 |
| generateAndSaveWeeklySummary | instrumented | 1 |
| getMonthBoundaries | instrumented | 0 |
| readMonthWeeklySummaries | skipped — Validation failed: COV-003 — COV-003 check failed: catch block at line 28 does not record error on span. Add span.recordException(error) and span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR }) in catch blocks to ensure errors are visible in traces. | 0 |

## Validation Journey
1. **Attempt 1**: 2 blocking errors (COV-003 (Error Recording):2)
2. **Attempt 2**: 3 blocking errors (COV-003 (Error Recording):1, NDS-005 (Control Flow Preserved):1, NDS-007 (Expected Catch Unmodified):1)
3. **Attempt 3**: function-level: 12/14 functions instrumented

## Advisory Findings
- COV-004 (Async Operation Spans):30: Fired because this async function doesn't have a span. Without one, traces have a gap here — callers can see time was spent and whether an error occurred, but not what happened inside this function. Add a span unless this is a pure synchronous utility with no I/O (RST-001 exemption) — context propagation covers unexported internal helpers.

- CDQ-007 (Attribute Data Quality):125: Fired for one or more of: a PII attribute name (like author, email, or username) or a raw filesystem path where a basename would be safer. PII in traces can violate privacy policies and is worth fixing. The path finding is lower severity — fix it when the code will run in a context where the basename utility is already imported.

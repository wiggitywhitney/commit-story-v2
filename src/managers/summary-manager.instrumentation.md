## Advisory Findings
- COV-004 (Async Operation Spans):30: COV-004 (Async Operation Spans) fired because this async function doesn't have a span. Without one, traces have a gap here — callers can see time was spent and whether an error occurred, but not what happened inside this function. Add a span unless this is a pure synchronous utility with no I/O (RST-001 exemption) — context propagation covers unexported internal helpers.
- CDQ-007 (Attribute Data Quality):61: CDQ-007 (Attribute Data Quality) fired for one or more of: a PII attribute name (like author, email, or username) or a raw filesystem path where a basename would be safer. PII in traces can violate privacy policies and is worth fixing. The path finding is lower severity — fix it when the code will run in a context where the basename utility is already imported.
- CDQ-007 (Attribute Data Quality):83: CDQ-007 (Attribute Data Quality) fired for one or more of: a PII attribute name (like author, email, or username) or a raw filesystem path where a basename would be safer. PII in traces can violate privacy policies and is worth fixing. The path finding is lower severity — fix it when the code will run in a context where the basename utility is already imported.
- CDQ-007 (Attribute Data Quality):149: CDQ-007 (Attribute Data Quality) fired for one or more of: a PII attribute name (like author, email, or username) or a raw filesystem path where a basename would be safer.

- CDQ-007 (Attribute Data Quality):204: CDQ-007 (Attribute Data Quality) fired for one or more of: a PII attribute name (like author, email, or username) or a raw filesystem path where a basename would be safer.

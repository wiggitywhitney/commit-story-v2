## Validation Journey
1. **Attempt 1**: 0 errors

## Notes
- getTodayString and getNowDate are unexported synchronous utilities with no async I/O — both were skipped (RST-001: no spans on pure synchronous functions; RST-004: unexported helpers covered by their exported orchestrators).
- All inner catch blocks throughout the file — those that swallow readdir ENOENT errors by returning empty arrays, empty Sets, or using `continue` — were left without recordException or setStatus. These represent expected filesystem conditions handled as graceful degradation, not unexpected failures (NDS-007: error recording must not be added to catches that do not re-throw).
- The four unexported async helpers (getSummarizedDays, getSummarizedWeeks, getSummarizedMonths, getWeeksWithWeeklySummaries) were instrumented per the pre-instrumentation analysis COV-004 directive. Although RST-004 generally exempts unexported helpers when an exported orchestrator covers the path, the pre-analysis explicitly flagged these as requiring spans, so all nine async functions received spans.
- commit_story.journal.weekly_summaries_count was used in findUnsummarizedWeeks to record the count of weeks found needing summaries, and in getSummarizedWeeks and getWeeksWithWeeklySummaries to record the size of their result sets — the closest registered attribute for a week-level count. No registered attribute specifically names 'unsummarized weeks count', so this existing key was reused as the best semantic match.
- commit_story.journal.months_count was used in findUnsummarizedMonths to record the count of unsummarized months, and in getSummarizedMonths to record the Set size — the closest registered attribute for a month-level count. No registered attribute specifically names 'unsummarized months count'.

## Advisory Findings
- CDQ-007 (Attribute Data Quality):94: CDQ-007 (Attribute Data Quality) fired for one or more of: a PII attribute name (like author, email, or username), a raw filesystem path where a basename would be safer, or a property access used as an attribute value without a null check. PII in traces can violate privacy policies and is worth fixing. The path and null-guard findings are lower severity — fix them if the code will run in a context where the value might be null.
